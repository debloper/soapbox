## What is soapbox?
- **Static blog engine/generator**
- Small, performant, non-opinionated
- (Almost) drop-in replacement for Jekyll
- With [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)-like content loading & navigation
- And architectural simplicity to encourage tinkering

## Why is soapbox?
Because the creator of `soapbox` wasn't happy with any single blogging platform/framework/engine/generator that does everything he wishes it to; and making yet another engine from scratch was easier than clobbering the existing ones to fit the need.

The blog had to be:

<dl>
  <dt>Lean</dt>
  <dd>Lean - in this context - is an intentionally overloaded term. It ordains <b>fast</b>, <b>focused</b>, <b>minimalistic</b>, <b>performant</b> & <b>uncompromising</b> behavior. Leanness, here, pursues that the <em>tool should never become the bottleneck of the product</em>.</dd>
  <dt>Flexible</dt>
  <dd>Differences in choices are to be respected, as long as it doesn't require going out of the way of leanness. The <code>soapbox</code> is not meant to be opinionated; although there are some preset defaults set here and there for now, those aren't meant to be permanent.</dd>
  <dt>Modular</dt>
  <dd>Flexibility is only practical, when the tool is modular enough to accommodate it. Replacing and reusing parts of the whole isn't only expected, it's encouraged.</dd>
  <dt>Modern</dt>
  <dd>Tools of today, and tools of the future should not cause the developer to rip their hairs off, working with <code>soapbox</code>. Modern is, one, that is capable of surfing the tide of time.</dd>
  <dt>Robust</dt>
  <dd>Even though, robustness is grossly a by-product of leanness, one can be lean without specificaly being robust. We seek both. <b>Availability</b>, <b>efficiency</b>, <b>portability</b>, <b>predictability</b> &amp; <b>stability</b> of <code>soapbox</code> can not be compromised.</dd>
  <dt>Static</dt>
  <dd>Most of what has been sought-after so far, is easier done as a server-side application. Which is why most popular blogging platforms require dynamic server & runtime, or the static ones make compromises along the way for pragmatism. Both alternatives are unacceptable for us.</dd>
  <dt>Blog-aware</dt>
  <dd>The main intent is to make a blog engine, afterall. It should be able to comprehend and handle the conventions, which are specific to blogs (slugs, tags, comments etc).</dd>
